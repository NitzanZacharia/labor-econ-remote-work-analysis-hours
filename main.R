# when the exposure measure was built on EXACTLY cell_fe_vars (the old design), it was collinear
# enough with its own controls/FE that the employment DDD's minimum detectable effect for
# Mother:Post:WFH_Exposure was ~51% of the baseline employment rate -- roughly 4x the actual point
# estimate, meaning the null result was uninformative, not evidence of a true null. Verified against
# real data (docs/decisions/exposure-cell-granularity-fix.md): adding MatzavMishpachti+Dat cut the
# MDE by ~37% (4,580 cells, only 2 below n=100). Adding BirthContinent on top of that (this update)
# cuts it a further ~18% (8,884 cells, median cell size 1,776, only 9 below n=100) -- a different
# mechanism than the first cut: BirthContinent measurably reduces WFH_Exposure's own measurement
# noise (raises its R^2 against the underlying occupation exposure score from 0.322 to 0.375 on the
# pre-period employed population), rather than only decorrelating it from cell_fe_vars.

# PRIMARY DDD as of the 2026-09-12 hours pivot (docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md) -- the
# extensive-margin DDD in 8b below is the secondary specification. Motivation: 8b's
# Mother:Post:WFH_Exposure remains underpowered even after the exposure-cell-granularity fixes (MDE
# ~26% of baseline employment, docs/decisions/exposure-cell-granularity-fix.md), and cell-level WLS
# aggregation was confirmed unable to recover further power (same memo's "Considered and rejected"
# section). This pivots the outcome to hours worked (WorkHoursCont, defined only for Employed==1)
# and the exposure regressor to the PURE occupation-level measure (exposure_calibrated's
# wfh_exposure_calibrated) -- safe here specifically because WorkHoursCont's own conditioning on
# employment is intrinsic to the question, unlike 8b's Employed outcome, where an occupation-level
# regressor would condition the DDD's own outcome on itself (see
# docs/decisions/exposure-cell-granularity-fix.md's rejection of that approach for the extensive

# existing basic_reg_jewish/arab precedent: no separate per-subgroup Lee-bounds/MDE run, since the
# analogous employment breakdown doesn't do that either and this is a heterogeneity check on the
# primary spec, not a new primary specification in its own right.
#

# once measurable (Post==1) -- the shift-share design's core relevance assumption, asserted in
# docs/decisions/calibrated-exposure-and-cell-ddd.md but never tested directly against real WFH
# data until now; (2) the closed-form minimum detectable effect for both employment-DDD specs, so
# the observed point estimates (0.103 additive / 0.131 cell-FE) can be read against how small a
