# Low-Level Design: Motherhood Penalty / WFH Analysis Pipeline

Derived from [`docs/HLD.md`](HLD.md) and the actual current state of the repository. The original 81-column table below was pulled directly from a real cached `cleaned_df.rds` (372,741 rows × 81 columns) as it stood at the time — not reconstructed from reading code — see the Verification note at the end. `data_processing.R` has since grown 6 more derived columns (`WFH_RefWeek`, `WFH_Hours`, `WFH_Share`, `WFH_Arrangement`, `ISCO_masked`, `ISCO1`), documented in a follow-on subsection below the original table; those 6 were reconciled directly from the current code, **not** from a fresh live pull, so their exact final column position (as opposed to their existence, type, and derivation) is not independently re-verified the way rows 1-81 were. The dataset is currently **372,741 rows × 87 columns**.

## Data Schema

`cleaned_df` (the output of `load_and_clean_data()`) is a flat tibble, currently 372,741 rows × 87 columns (81 as of the original live pull below, plus 6 documented in the follow-on subsection). Columns fall into three classes:

- **Derived (new)** — created by `data_processing.R`, not present in the raw CBS extract.
- **Type-transformed** — a raw CBS column, converted to `factor` or recoded/grouped in place (same column name, new representation).
- **Raw passthrough** — an untouched raw CBS column (Hebrew-named, numeric or character), surviving the drop step unchanged.

**Schema-quality gap**: the ~65 raw-passthrough columns above have no explicit final-format contract — no renaming, no type normalization (numeric vs. character is whatever `read_csv()` guessed), no documented meaning beyond the original CBS codebook. Only the columns actually consumed downstream (§ below) have a defined contract. This is a real gap if the dataset is ever handed to someone without codebook access.

### Columns added since the original 81-column pull

Reconciled directly from the current `data_processing.R` (not a fresh live pull — see the note at the top of this document). All 6 are genuinely new columns (not present in the original pull), so they sit after column 81 in creation order; their exact final index is not independently re-verified.

| Column | Type | Class | Derivation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WFH_RefWeek` | numeric | Derived | Reference-week WFH behaviour, from `AvadMeHaBayit` (same 1/2/9→1/0/NA mapping as `WFH`). Created immediately after `WFH` in `data_processing.R`'s WFH block. |
| `WFH_Hours` | numeric | Derived | Hours worked from home in the reference week, from `KamaShaot` (only defined when `WFH_RefWeek == 1`). |
| `WFH_Share` | numeric | Derived | `WFH_Hours / ShaotAvodaLeMaase`, capped at 1. |
| `WFH_Arrangement` | factor (3 levels) | Derived | Binned from `WFH_Share`: On-site / Hybrid / Fully remote. |
| `ISCO_masked` | logical | Derived | `TRUE` where the raw `MishlachYad_ISCO_08_2` held a CBS disclosure mask (`XX`, `7X`, …) rather than a numeric code. Created in the ISCO block, immediately after column 57's type transform. |
| `ISCO1` | numeric | Derived | 1-digit ISCO-08 major group, recovered from the first character of the raw code (survives partial masking, e.g. `7X` → `7`). |

See the "Analysis-critical derived columns" table below for each column's exact NA-rate contract and derivation logic.

### Analysis-critical derived columns (exact contract)

| Column | Type | Values / levels | NA rate | Derivation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Employed` | integer | `{0, 1}` | **0.000%** | `1` iff `Muasak == 1`, else `0` (unemployed + not-in-labor-force both → `0`). **Secondary outcome variable** (and the selection variable for `WorkHoursCont`'s Lee-bounds correction) — see `docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md`. |
| `Mother` | integer | `{0, 1}` | **0.000%** | `1` iff `MisparYeladimAd17MB > 0` |
| `Post` | integer | `{0, 1}` | **0.000%** | `1` iff `ShnatSeker >= 2021` |
| `WFH` | numeric | `{0, 1}` | 64.726% | Usual work location, from `AvodaMeHaBayit`: `1`→`1`, `2`→`0`, `9` ("unknown")→**`NA`**, blank→`NA`. Only defined for `ShnatSeker >= 2021`; `NA` for all pre-2021 rows *by design* (question wasn't asked). The NA rate rose from 63.938% when code `9` stopped being silently recoded as `0` |
| `WFH_RefWeek` | numeric | `{0, 1}` | 68.629% | Reference-week behaviour, from `AvadMeHaBayit`, same code mapping. Asked only of the employed who worked that week (`AvadBeshavua == 1`), so the employed-but-absent are `NA`, not `0`. Disagrees with `WFH` in both directions — 6,182 rows in 2021 answer "no" to usual and "yes" to reference-week |
| `WFH_Hours` | numeric | `[0, 84]` | 68.648% | Hours worked from home in the reference week, from `KamaShaot` (asked only when `WFH_RefWeek == 1`). `0` when `WFH_RefWeek == 0`; `NA` when either hour item carries a CBS code in the 90s ("irregular"/"unknown") |
| `WFH_Share` | numeric | `[0, 1]` | 68.659% | `WFH_Hours / ShaotAvodaLeMaase`, capped at 1. `0` when `WFH_RefWeek == 0`; `NA` whenever `WFH_RefWeek` is `NA` or either hour item is a 90s code. Verified `KamaShaot <= ShaotAvodaLeMaase` in 18,619/18,619 valid 2021 cases |
| `WFH_Arrangement` | factor (3 levels) | `On-site` (91,480), `Hybrid` (15,685), `Fully remote` (9,655) | 68.659% | Binned from `WFH_Share`: `0` → On-site, `(0, 0.9)` → Hybrid, `>= 0.9` → Fully remote |
| `ISCO_masked` | logical | `{TRUE, FALSE}` | **0.000%** | `TRUE` where the raw `MishlachYad_ISCO_08_2` held a CBS disclosure mask (`XX`, `7X`, …) rather than a code. 2.365% of the analysis sample; 7.5% of all employed in the raw 2021 file, since masking concentrates in thin occupation cells |
| `ISCO1` | numeric | `[1, 9]` | 18.052% | 1-digit ISCO-08 major group, recovered from the first character of the raw code so partially-masked values (`7X` → `7`) survive. Non-`NA` for 231 employed 2021 rows that `MishlachYad_ISCO_08_2` loses entirely |
| `WorkHoursCont` | numeric | `[0, 78.5]` | 0.001% (3 rows) | Bin-median lookup for `ShaotAvodaBederechKlalNK` codes 0–10; codes 11/12 imputed from the median of the matching bin range, computed separately within each `Post` period (not pooled across 2017–2023 — pooling would blend the pre/post hour distributions and dampen any real period-specific intensity shift); `NA` for code 99. **Primary outcome variable** (project-wide, as of `docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md`) — defined only for `Employed == 1` rows. |
| `TeudaGvoha` | factor (6 levels) | `Below High School`, `High School (no matriculation)`, `Matriculation (Bagrut)`, `Post-secondary, non-academic`, `Academic Degree (BA/MA/PhD)`, `Other/No Certificate` | 2.135% | Collapsed from 11 raw codes; `NA` reserved for raw code 99 ("unknown") |
| `BirthContinent` | factor (6 levels) | `Africa`, `Asia`, `Europe`, `Israel`, `North America`, `Other` | 0.218% | Collapsed from 16 raw `SemelEretzLeda` codes; `NA` reserved for raw code 16 (ambiguous "unknown"/"other" in CBS's own codebook) |
| `WorksOutsideLocality` | integer | `{0, 1}` | 16.552% | From `DargatNayadut`: `1`→`0`, `2`–`7`→`1`, `0`/`8`/`NA`→`NA` |

Regression-control columns (`MatzavMishpachti`, `Dat`, `GilNK`, `MachozMegurim`, `MisparHorimYechidim`) are all `factor`, all **0.000% NA** (confirmed from the live data).

## Validation & Thresholds

### Hard-fail checks (pipeline should stop; implemented in `validation.R`'s `validate_cleaned_df()`)

| Check | Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Sex filter invariant | `all(cleaned_df$Min == 2)` | `Min==2` is applied once at filter time; any other value surfacing downstream means the filter itself broke |
| Age filter invariant | `all(as.integer(as.character(cleaned_df$GilNK)) %in% 3:7)` | Same reasoning for the age-group filter |
| Year filter invariant | `all(cleaned_df$ShnatSeker %in% c(2017,2018,2019,2021,2022,2023))` | 2020 must never appear |
| `Employed`/`Mother`/`Post` NA rate | must equal exactly `0` | All three are `if_else()`-derived from always-defined inputs (`Muasak`, `MisparYeladimAd17MB`, `ShnatSeker`); *any* NA appearing means a regression in the derivation logic, not real-world missingness |
| Row count sanity | `nrow(cleaned_df) > 0` after each filter stage | Catches a filter that accidentally empties the frame |

### Soft-fail / warn thresholds (calibrated against the real observed rates above)

| Rule | Threshold | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Any *regression control's* NA rate | warn if `> 5%` | None currently exceed this — `TeudaGvoha` at 2.1% is the highest control-level NA rate observed; a control crossing 5% would meaningfully shrink the regression's effective sample via `fixest`'s listwise deletion |
| Any *comparative-stats-only* variable's NA rate | warn if `> 70%` (informational only below that) | `WFH` at 63.9% is structurally expected (pre-2021 undefined by design), not a data-quality problem — the threshold should sit above it so `WFH` doesn't false-positive, while still catching a genuinely broken variable |
| `WorksOutsideLocality` NA rate | no warn below `~20%` | Its 16.6% NA is structurally expected (`DargatNayadut` codes 0/8 = didn't work / unknown), consistent across years |

### Null-handling logic, by variable class

1. **Derived binary outcomes** (`Employed`, `Mother`, `Post`) — never `NA` by construction; treat any `NA` as a hard failure, not data to impute. `Employed` is now the secondary outcome variable; the primary outcome, `WorkHoursCont`, is continuous and handled separately (see the "Analysis-critical derived columns" table above).
2. **Category-grouping variables** (`TeudaGvoha`, `BirthContinent`) — `NA` is reserved *specifically* for the raw "unknown" code (99 / 16 respectively), never introduced by the grouping logic itself for a valid code. `fixest::feols()` silently listwise-deletes these rows; that's acceptable given the low rates above, but should be watched if raw data quality changes.
3. **Structurally-conditional variables** (`WFH`) — `NA` encodes "question not applicable this year," not missingness. Must never be imputed or treated as `0`.
4. **Mobility/commute variables** (`WorksOutsideLocality`) — `NA` covers both "didn't work" and "unknown," which are semantically different but not currently distinguished; flagged as a modeling simplification, not a defect.

### Schema-drift check (implemented in `validation.R`'s `check_schema_drift()`)

`data_processing.R` drops column ranges positionally (`select(-(a:b))`), which depend on the raw CSV's column *order*, not names — originally 7 ranges, now 5 (2 were converted to explicit `any_of()`-based name drops after `2017_Data.csv` turned out to lack all 4 of those boundary columns entirely, which made the positional check fail on a file that was never going to contain them in the first place). `check_schema_drift(folder_path)` asserts, for every year's raw CSV independently, that the named boundary columns of each of the 5 remaining ranges (`Yeladim0_1Prat`/`Yeladim15_17Prat`, `MisparHachlafa`/`YachasKirvaNK`, `MisparNefashotGilAvodaV2007`/`MisparPrat`, `ChipusAvodaSherutTaasuka`/`ChipusAvodaOfenAcher`, `RamatDat`/`BituachLeumi`) occupy the same relative column position across every file, throwing a clear error rather than silently dropping the wrong columns if a future CBS release reorders them. Called from `main.R` before every fresh (non-cached) `load_and_clean_data()` run.

## HLD Gap Analysis

**Status: closed.** Every gap this table originally tracked (validation/threshold checks, the schema-drift check, the intensive-margin regression, the WFH-exposure index, the DDD mechanism regression, the Gender Placebo Test, and the persisted output/export layer) is now implemented — see `docs/HLD.md` §4.1 for the full current file list, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the checkpoint history. The one item below that was ever a genuine data-availability blocker (not an engineering gap) was resolved as a recorded decision rather than closed by acquiring new data:

| Original gap | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Continuous `Age`/`Age²` controls — confirmed absent from the raw CBS extract entirely (no `Gil`/`ShnatLeda`-equivalent column exists) | **Decided, not built**: `docs/decisions/checkpoint8-age-age2-controls.md` formally replaces this control with the categorical `GilNK` already in use everywhere — matching Part 3 §3's own advisor feedback for categorical dummies. Not an open gap. |

Work has since gone **beyond** what this table or the original roadmap scoped — a statistically-calibrated exposure measure and a cell-based primary DDD (`wfh_exposure_cells.R`, `docs/decisions/calibrated-exposure-and-cell-ddd.md`), a Lee (2009) selection-bounds correction for the intensive margin (`docs/decisions/intensive-margin-lee-bounds.md`), and several runtime diagnostics (`validation.R`'s `check_idpuf_panel_structure()`/`check_wfh_refweek_avadbeshavua()`, `isco_masking_diagnostics.R`, `ddd_collinearity_diagnostics.R`). None of these are "gaps" in the sense this table originally meant (missing pieces of the research-doc spec) — they're refinements layered on top of a complete spec, each with its own decision memo. See `docs/HLD.md` §4.2 for the current list of documented limitations and deliberate decisions (survey weights not applied, Lee bounds' one-directional limitation, etc.) — that's the accurate analogue of this section today.

## Implementation Roadmap

**Status: complete.** The 9-step build order this section originally specified (validation guard → schema-drift check → intensive-margin regression → controls de-duplication → WFH-exposure index → DDD mechanism regression → Gender Placebo Test → Age/Age² decision → export layer) matches `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s 10 checkpoints and all of it has shipped. For what's been built since, see `docs/HLD.md` §4.1's file table and the decision memos in `docs/decisions/`. There is currently no pending roadmap item — new work should get its own checkpoint entry or decision memo (per `CLAUDE.md`'s convention) rather than being implemented ad hoc, so a future reader can find the rationale the way this section once made possible for the original 9.

## Verification

The original 81-column Data Schema and Validation sections were generated by loading the actual `cleaned_df.rds` cache (372,741 × 81, as it stood at the time) and dumping real column names, types, factor levels, and NA rates via `Rscript` — not reconstructed from reading source code. The Age/Age² data-availability claim was confirmed by grepping every raw CSV header for age- and birth-year-related column names before writing it down as absent — this remains true; it's the reason `docs/decisions/checkpoint8-age-age2-controls.md` exists. The 6 columns added since (see "Columns added since the original 81-column pull") and the "Core Function Signatures" section were reconciled directly against the current `.R` files in this repo, not from a fresh `Rscript` data pull — flagged wherever that distinction matters. `Validation & Thresholds`' hard/soft-fail checks and the schema-drift check are no longer a design spec; both are implemented in `validation.R` and can be read directly from source.
