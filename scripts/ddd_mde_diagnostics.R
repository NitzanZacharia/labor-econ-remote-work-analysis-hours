# ddd_mde_diagnostics.R
# Closed-form minimum-detectable-effect (MDE) diagnostic for the primary DDD's triple interaction.
# check_spec1_collinearity() (ddd_collinearity_diagnostics.R) already quantifies how much of
# WFH_Exposure's cross-cell variance survives after partialling out its own controls (~25.5% in
# Spec 1), and Spec 2 identifies the triple interaction off within-cell variation only -- this
# function turns those SEs into an interpretable "smallest true effect this design could reliably
# detect" number, so a null Mother:Post:WFH_Exposure coefficient can be read as "genuinely null" vs.
# "underpowered to see a plausible effect."
#
# Standard closed-form MDE for a linear-model coefficient (Duflo, Glennerster & Kremer 2007):
#   MDE = SE * (qnorm(1 - sig_level / 2) + qnorm(power))
# No simulation and no new dependency -- qnorm() is base R, matching this repo's existing
# base-R-only convention for statistical diagnostics (ddd_collinearity_diagnostics.R explicitly
# avoids adding car for the same reason).
