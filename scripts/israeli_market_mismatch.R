# Descriptive-only exhibit: how far did Israeli WFH adoption (2022-2023, the "new normal" after
# the initial pandemic disruption settled) diverge from Dingel & Neiman's theoretical
# teleworkability by occupation. This is a thin wrapper around calibrate_isco_exposure() -- the
# same function main.R uses to build the DDD's exposure measures -- so the swap/no-swap call here
# is identical to the one that actually feeds the regression, rather than an independently-chosen
# floor that could disagree with main.R's `min_n` on which occupations are well-powered enough to
# trust.
