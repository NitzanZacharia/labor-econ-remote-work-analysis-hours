# ddd_collinearity_diagnostics.R
# Runtime collinearity diagnostic for main.R's employment DDD Spec 1 (additive controls): the share
# of WFH_Exposure's variance explained by GilNK+TeudaGvoha+MachozMegurim and the design-matrix
# condition number, computed from the fitted data on every run so they can't silently go
# stale as the underlying microdata composition changes (new survey years, sample restrictions,
# etc.). Spec 2 (main.R's interacted-cell-FE spec) is the actual fix for this collinearity -- this
# function only measures and reports how bad Spec 1's collinearity is, it doesn't correct anything.
#
# Base R only (lm(), kappa()) -- deliberately avoids adding car as a new dependency (CLAUDE.md:
# flag new dependencies before adding). car::vif() additionally computes a generalized VIF (GVIF)
# for multi-level factors, correcting for the fact that a naive per-dummy-column VIF overstates
# collinearity purely from a factor's own dummy coding -- not needed here, since the only VIF this
# reports is WFH_Exposure's own (a single numeric column, where naive and generalized VIF coincide).

# Generic safety net for every OTHER feols()/lm() fit in the pipeline: check_spec1_collinearity()
# above only ever covered the primary DDD's Spec 1, by design (it's specifically diagnosing that
# spec's own known WFH_Exposure/cell-control overlap).
#
# IMPORTANT, verified empirically against the fixest version this project uses: a collinear
# variable is NOT left in coef() as an NA-valued entry -- fixest removes it from coef() entirely
# (confirmed: feols(y ~ x1 + x2) with x2 <- x1 gives coef() = c("(Intercept)", "x1") only, and
# is.na(coef(m)) is all FALSE). The reliable accessor is the fitted model's own $collin.var, which
# fixest populates with exactly the dropped variable names (NULL/character(0) when nothing was
# dropped). An earlier version of this check used is.na(coef(...)) and would have silently done
# NOTHING -- always worth re-verifying a third-party package's actual behavior instead of assuming
# it from a description.
#
# expected_drops lets a caller name variables it ALREADY KNOWS will be dropped by design (e.g.
# main.R's Spec 2: WFH_Exposure's bare main effect is intentionally collinear with the interacted
# cell FE -- see main.R's own comment and test-employment_ddd_mechanics.R). Only UNEXPECTED drops
# trigger a warning; warning(), not stop(), since killing the whole main.R run over one collinear
# coefficient in a robustness spec would be disproportionate -- matches this codebase's existing
# non-destructive convention (e.g. calibrate_isco_exposure() keeps a theoretical value rather than
# aborting).
