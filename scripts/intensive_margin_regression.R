# Checkpoint 4 (docs/ROADMAP.md): the intensive-margin (weekly work hours) DiD, per the research
# doc's core DiD spec (Part 2 §1 / Part 4 §2), which models both an employment indicator and
# weekly work hours. As of the hours pivot (docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md), this is the
# project's PRIMARY dependent-variable regression; basic_regression.R's extensive-margin (Employed)
# model is the secondary/comparison regression. Hours are only meaningful conditional on being
# employed, so this is estimated on the Employed == 1 subsample.
