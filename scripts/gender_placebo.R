# Checkpoint 5 (docs/ROADMAP.md): the Gender Placebo Test from the research doc (Part 2 §3 /
# Part 4 §5) -- replicates the primary DiD model on men (fathers vs. childless men) instead of
# women, to test whether the observed effect is specifically a *motherhood* penalty rather than a
# general *parenthood* or macro shift. Reuses basic_reg() as-is: the "Mother" column (1 if any
# children <17) is sex-agnostic in its derivation, so for this male subsample it's conceptually
# read as "Father" without any code/column rename.
#
# Extended for the DDD placebo (Mother*Post*WFH_Exposure): the two-way basic_reg() placebo above
# tests whether *any* Mother:Post effect exists for men; it says nothing about whether men's
# employment response also happens to track occupational WFH exposure, which is what the primary
# DDD (main.R's ddd_employment_additive / ddd_employment_fe) actually claims. WFH_Exposure itself
# is occupation-level, not sex-specific, so the same calibrated occupation scores
# (exposure_calibrated, built from WOMEN's realized 2022-23 WFH -- see wfh_exposure_cells.R) are
# reused unchanged as the measurement instrument; only
# the cell shift-share weights are rebuilt on men's own pre-period (2017-2019) occupation
# composition, via build_exposure_cells(cleaned_men, ...). This holds "how exposed is this
# occupation" fixed and swaps only the population being tested, which is what a placebo requires.
