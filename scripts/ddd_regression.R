# ddd_regression.R
# Checkpoint 7 (docs/ROADMAP.md): the Triple-Differences mechanism test (research doc Part 2 §2 /
# Part 4 §4), testing whether the narrowing of the motherhood penalty is actually driven by an
# occupation's WFH exposure. Depends on Checkpoint 6's build_wfh_exposure_index().
#
# SECONDARY DDD (extensive margin, Employed outcome) as of the hours pivot
# (docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md) -- hours_ddd_regression.R's run_hours_ddd_regression() is now
# the project's primary DDD (intensive margin, WorkHoursCont outcome, pure occupation-level
# exposure). This file's triple-interaction + second-stage mechanism regression is still run and
# reported (main.R's §8b-8e), just no longer the headline specification.

  # Occupations with too little data for basic_reg() to fit (e.g. very small n) are dropped from
  # the mechanism regression rather than erroring the whole function.
  #
  # beta_j's precision varies enormously across occupations (subsample sizes range from the
  # min-viable-fit floor up to tens of thousands of rows), so treating every beta_j as equally
  # informative in an unweighted lm() lets noisy, small-n occupations distort the fitted
  # exposure-mechanism slope as much as large, precisely-estimated ones. reg_mechanism is
  # therefore a standard inverse-variance-weighted (precision-weighted) second-stage regression --
