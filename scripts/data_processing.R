    # Gated on Employed == 1: "usual weekly hours" is only meaningful for someone who has a job.
    # Previously ungated, a non-employed row with a populated ShaotAvodaBederechKlalNK code (a real
    # possibility, not just a synthetic edge case -- e.g. a data-entry quirk where the hours item
    # wasn't nulled out) got a literal number (bin 0 -> 0.0), indistinguishable from an employed
    # person who reported the lowest hours bin. Every existing downstream consumer already
    # restricts to Employed == 1 before touching WorkHoursCont (intensive_margin_regression.R,
    # intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R), so this doesn't change any regression result -- it just
    # makes the variable itself correctly undefined for the population it was never meant to
    # describe. The code-11/12 donor pool is restricted to Employed == 1 rows for the same reason
    # ("median hours among regular ... workers", per the comment above).
    #
    # ALSO gated on AvadBeshavua == 1 (worked in the reference week), which harmonizes the hours
    # population across survey years -- see docs/decisions/hours-population-harmonization.md.
    # The problem this solves: bin 0 is not a "bad" code, it means "no usual hours / did not work",
    # and CBS uses it in every year (16,821 non-employed rows in 2017, 15,601 in 2018, ...). What
    # is 2017-specific is that the 2017 file ALSO used it for the employed-but-absent: AvadBeshavua
    # partitions 2017's employed perfectly, with all 5,169 bin-0 rows at code 4 (did not work that
    # week) and all 47,729 others at code 1. From 2018 on, that same population was given a real
    # usual-hours code instead. The absentee group is ~10% of the employed in every year
    # (9.8/10.3/10.6/12.0/9.9/10.4% for 2017-2023), so the population is stable -- only its coding
    # changed.
    #
    # Gating on bin 0 alone would therefore NOT fix this: it would leave 2017 conditioning on
    # "worked that week" while the other five years did not. Since absenteeism is mother-skewed
    # (12.4% of employed mothers vs 7.3% of non-mothers), that is differential selection on exactly
    # the dimension this project's estimand contrasts, and it overshoots -- the 2017 raw gap lands
    # at -1.373 against 2018's -1.571 and 2019's -1.678, i.e. past them rather than onto them.
    # Restricting every year to the reference-week workers instead makes the hours population
    # identical across years, at the cost of ~10% of each year's hours sample and a slightly
    # narrower estimand: usual hours among those who worked the reference week.
    #
    # The bin-0 branch below is redundant on today's data (every 2017 bin-0 row is AvadBeshavua==4,
    # so the gate above already catches it) and is kept only as a guard: a bin-0 row that DID work
    # the reference week would otherwise still be handed a literal 0 by the %in% 0:10 branch.
    # Note hour_bin_median's `0` = 0 entry (top of this file) is not wrong in itself -- 0 is the
    # right ACTUAL hours for someone who did not work. It is wrong only as a USUAL-hours value,
    # which is what this variable is.
