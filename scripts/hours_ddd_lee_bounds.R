# hours_ddd_lee_bounds.R
# Generalizes intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R's DiD-adapted Lee (2009) trimming bounds from the plain
# 2x2 (Mother x Post) intensive-margin regression to hours_ddd_regression.R's triple-interaction
# DDD (Mother x Post x WFH_Exposure). See docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md for the full rationale.
#
# ── Why this function uses TWO different WFH_Exposure measures ─────────────────────────────────
# hours_ddd_regression.R's point estimate uses the PURE occupation-level exposure
# (exposure_calibrated's wfh_exposure_calibrated, joined by MishlachYad_ISCO_08_2) as the
# continuous regressor -- it's the more precise measure of a specific job's teleworkability, but it
# is UNDEFINED for anyone without an observed occupation, i.e. the non-employed. The whole point of
# a Lee-bounds correction here is to bound the bias from those very rows being dropped -- which
# means the selection-into-employment counterfactual (s_ab below) must be computable for people who
# are NOT employed, so it cannot be stratified by an exposure measure that only exists for the
# employed. It is instead stratified by quartiles of the demographic-cell-based WFH_Exposure
# (build_exposure_cells()'s shift-share measure, defined for the full sample regardless of
# employment status -- the same measure the EXTENSIVE-margin primary DDD in main.R uses), reusing
# robustness/age_balance_robustness.R's existing compute_pre_period_quartile_breaks()/
# assign_wfh_quartile() helpers unchanged.
#
# So: cell-based WFH_Exposure quartiles stratify WHO gets bounded together (a property observable
# pre-employment); occupation-level WFH_Exposure is what the bounded regression actually estimates
# against (a property only observable once employed). Using one measure for both roles is not
# possible -- the occupation-level measure can't stratify the non-employed, and the cell-based
# measure is a coarser, noisier stand-in for what the DDD's own regressor is trying to capture (see
# docs/decisions/exposure-cell-granularity-fix.md's rejection of using a demographic-cell measure to
# approximate individual-level occupation exposure, and vice versa).
#
# ── The bound construction, generalized from intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R ─────────────────────
# For each quartile q of the cell-based WFH_Exposure (computed on the FULL cell-matched sample,
# employed and non-employed alike):
#   s_ab(q) = P(hours observed | Mother==a, Post==b, WFH_Exposure_Q==q)  for a,b in {0,1}
#             (employed AND worked the reference week -- the estimation sample, not the employed;
#              see docs/decisions/hours-population-harmonization.md)
#   s11_counterfactual(q) = s10(q) + (s01(q) - s00(q))
# If s11(q) exceeds this counterfactual, trim_prop(q) = 1 - s11_counterfactual(q)/s11(q) is trimmed
# from that quartile's own Mother==1 & Post==1 slice of the EMPLOYED, occupation-matched sample
# (top-trim by WorkHoursCont for the lower bound, bottom-trim for the upper bound -- same
# monotone-selection assumption as the original function). Each quartile is trimmed independently,
# using its own selection rates -- this tests whether excess selection itself is concentrated in
# particular exposure quartiles, not just present on average. The four quartiles' trimmed subsets
# are recombined into one lower-bound sample and one upper-bound sample, and the full triple-
# interaction formula is refit on point/lower/upper exactly as hours_ddd_regression.R specifies it.
#
# ── Limitations (in addition to intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R's own, which all still apply here:
# only handles EXCESS selection, relies on the extensive-margin DiD's own parallel-trends
# assumption, assumes monotone selection, ties broken by row order) ────────────────────────────
# - The "point" (untrimmed) fit here additionally requires a matched CELL-based exposure (to be
#   assignable to a quartile), on top of hours_ddd_regression.R's own occupation-match requirement
#   -- so this function's own point estimate can differ very slightly in sample from calling
#   run_hours_ddd_regression() directly (the ~1.3% of rows with no matched exposure cell, per
#   docs/decisions/exposure-cell-granularity-fix.md, are additionally excluded here).
# - A quartile with very few Mother==1,Post==1 rows makes that quartile's own trim_prop noisy, and
#   if excess selection is detected in a quartile with a small denominator, the trim itself may
#   remove nearly all of that quartile's post-period mothers. n_by_quartile in the diagnostics
#   output should be checked before trusting the bounds; a warning is emitted for any quartile
#   below MIN_CELL_WARN rows.
