# isco_masking_diagnostics.R
# Sensitivity check for CBS's ISCO-08 disclosure-masking and the WFH-exposure index (audit
# finding: masking concentrates in thinly-populated occupation cells -- 7.5% of all employed 2021
# rows, 2.4% of the analysis sample -- and every place ISCO2 is used as a join key
# (wfh_exposure_index.R, wfh_exposure_cells.R) drops masked rows via !is.na(). If masked
# occupations differ systematically in realized WFH from unmasked ones, the exposure index is
# built on a non-random subsample of occupations, biasing it in an unknown direction).
#
# This can't be resolved outright -- a fully-masked "XX" row carries zero occupation signal at any
# resolution and is necessarily excluded here too. But a PARTIALLY masked row ("7X") still has its
# 1-digit major group recoverable as ISCO1 (data_processing.R). Comparing realized WFH between
# masked and unmasked rows *within the same ISCO1 major group* is therefore a defensible, if
# imperfect, proxy check:
#   - if masked and unmasked rows look similar within a major group, that's reassuring (though not
#     proof -- masking could still correlate with a finer distinction ISCO1 can't see);
#   - if they look different even after conditioning on the coarse occupation family, that's
#     evidence the masking-driven exclusion could be biasing the exposure index, and the gap
#     reported below quantifies by how much, group by group.
