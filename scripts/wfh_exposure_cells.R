# Corrects the external (Dingel & Neiman) teleworkability score where Israeli institutional
# reality diverges sharply from the US-task-based prediction -- the standing example is teaching
# (ISCO 23): D&N scores it 0.966 (near-ceiling teleworkable), but Israeli teachers essentially
# don't work from home (realized 2022-23 usage 0.063) because schools stayed in-person by Ministry
# of Education policy, not by individual choice.
#
# A gap this size is real, not noise, for ISCO 23 (n = 12,881). But a flat gap threshold applied
# to every occupation regardless of sample size lets a handful of observations swap the index --
# e.g. ISCO 63 (subsistence farmers), n = 4, would swap 0.000 -> 0.750 on that alone. So the swap
# is only made when the gap exceeds the substantive threshold (gap_threshold) by more than the
# realized estimate's own sampling uncertainty: a one-sided test that the TRUE gap exceeds
# gap_threshold, at conf_level confidence, using a cluster-robust SE (cluster = IDPUF -- this
# project's own convention everywhere else regressions are run; roughly 15,000 IDPUFs repeat
# across the pooled 2022-2023 window this draws on by default, so an unclustered SE understates
# uncertainty by ~54% on average -- confirmed against the real data before this threshold was
# adopted). Occupations too thin to compute a cluster-robust SE at all (e.g. ISCO 63) fail the
# test automatically and keep their theoretical value, the same outcome a min_n floor would give,
# but without a second, independently-chosen number to justify.

  # person surveyed 4 times in 2023, and fixest reports "infinite or missing values in 'x'"), or a
  # constant outcome within the occupation (feols refuses an intercept-only fit on a constant DV).
  # Both are checked explicitly and handled the same way (kept at theoretical, not swapped) rather
  # than being funneled through a blanket tryCatch(error=..., warning=...) -- that would silently
  # swallow a genuinely unexpected failure too (e.g. a mistyped wfh_col), turning a real bug into
  # "nothing got swapped" with zero diagnostic trace. Any OTHER error is still caught (fixest is a
  # third-party dependency; a truly unanticipated failure shouldn't halt the whole pipeline) but is
  # always reported below with the specific occupation and error text, not swallowed silently.
