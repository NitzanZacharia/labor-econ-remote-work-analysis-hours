# balance_test.R
# Phase 1b: pre-period covariate balance between Mother==1 and Mother==0, checked separately
# within WFH_Exposure quartiles (built the same way as the secondary/employment DDD's cell-based
# exposure -- main.R's exposure_cells construction), restricted to the pre-period
# (ShnatSeker < 2020, i.e. 2017-2019 -- 2020 itself is never in the sample). A straightforward covariate-balance table, not a new modeling
# framework: GilNK is treated as an ordinal numeric code (mean + Welch t-test by Mother, per
# quartile); the remaining DEFAULT_CONTROLS (MatzavMishpachti, Dat, MachozMegurim, TeudaGvoha) are
# nominal factors, so "mean" isn't meaningful -- each is reported as a %-distribution by Mother,
# per quartile, with a chi-square test of independence.
#
# cleaned_df is expected to be the primary (women) analysis sample, matching main.R's ddd_df.
