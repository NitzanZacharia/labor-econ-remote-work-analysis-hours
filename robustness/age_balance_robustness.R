# age_balance_robustness.R
# Follow-up to the Phase 1b balance test: GilNK (age group) is imbalanced between Mother==1 and
# Mother==0 in the pre-period, concentrated in the lowest WFH_Exposure quartile, even though GilNK
# is already an additive DEFAULT_CONTROLS term. Builds three COMPARISON specs against the primary
# DDD's formulas (main.R's ddd_employment_additive / ddd_employment_fe) -- does NOT modify main.R.
#
#   1. diagnose_gilnk_by_quartile() -- age gap by Mother status, per WFH_Exposure quartile.
#   2. run_ddd_age_interacted()     -- adds Mother:GilNK (a fully saturated age x motherhood term)
#      to both of those formulas, on top of the existing DEFAULT_CONTROLS.
#   3. build_gilnk_rake_weights() + run_ddd_reweighted() -- pre-period-derived weights that
#      equalize each Mother group's GilNK distribution (within WFH_Exposure quartile) to the
#      pooled pre-period quartile distribution, then applied to the full-period regression. For a
#      single discrete covariate with adequate cell sizes this is the exact solution entropy
#      balancing would also converge to (both minimize KL divergence to the same target marginal;
#      the two diverge only when exact reweighting is infeasible, e.g. a target cell with zero
#      support in one group -- build_gilnk_rake_weights() checks for and reports that). Kept
#      dependency-free (no new package) per CLAUDE.md's "flag before adding a dependency".
#   4. run_hours_ddd_age_interacted() / run_hours_ddd_reweighted() -- hours-outcome (primary DDD)
#      analogs of #2/#3, added for the hours pivot (docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md). See their
#      own header comment below for how they differ structurally from #2/#3.
#
# All three use the SAME WFH_Exposure quartile definition -- breakpoints computed once from the
# pre-period distribution via compute_pre_period_quartile_breaks(), then applied identically to
# pre- and full-period rows via cut(). Computing quartiles independently on two different row sets
# (e.g. two separate ntile() calls) would silently misalign the quartile labels between the
# weight-building step and the full-period regression, since ntile()'s cutpoints depend on
# whichever rows it happens to be ranking.
