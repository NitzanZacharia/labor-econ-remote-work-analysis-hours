**The Impact of Remote Work on the "Motherhood Penalty": An Empirical Analysis of the Israeli Labor Market in the Post-COVID Era.**

Empirical analysis using Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Labor Force Survey microdata to test whether the post-COVID shift to remote work altered the motherhood penalty in the Israeli labor market.

## Background

**Motivation.** Israel combines high labor productivity with birth rates that are exceptionally high compared to the rest of the OECD, so changes in the motherhood penalty carry outsized economic weight. The findings are intended to inform local policy debates on gender equality, maternity leave, and flexible work arrangements.

**The motherhood penalty.** A well-documented negative effect of childbirth on women's wages and employment, opening a persistent gap between mothers and both men and childless women (long-term wage penalties of roughly 20–40% in the literature). It's driven by mothers shifting to part-time/"mommy track" roles, an unequal household/childcare burden, and "commitment bias" discrimination by employers who perceive mothers as less committed.
- Correll et al. (2007): mothers face wage/hiring discrimination from a "less committed" stereotype; fathers see the opposite — a wage premium.
- Kleven et al. (2019, Denmark): first childbirth causes a ~20% long-term income decline for women, via reduced hours, labor-market exit, or a shift to lower-paying family-friendly jobs.
- Kleven et al. (2019, cross-country): the penalty is universal but its severity tracks cultural/gender norms, steepest where mothers are expected to stay home.
- Harrington et al. (2025): rising remote work is shrinking the penalty — higher employment for mothers in demanding professions, less post-birth dropout, easier work/parenting integration.

**Why remote work might change it.** The pandemic pushed work-from-home from ~5% to ~25–30% of workdays. This could narrow the penalty (less commute friction, more schedule flexibility, reduced stigma around physical availability) or widen it (lower visibility, slower advancement, new remote-specific stigma) — which is why this is an empirical question rather than an assumed direction.

## Research design

The core analysis is a mother/non-mother × pre/post-2021 difference-in-differences design, using the COVID-era shift toward remote work as the "post" treatment period:

$$Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Mother}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Post}_t + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{Mother}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + X'_{it}\gamma + \varepsilon_{it}$$

- **Y**: weekly work hours (intensive margin, **primary**) and employment (extensive margin, secondary).
- **Mother**: 1 for women with a child under 17 (treatment group); 0 for childless women (control group).
- **Post**: 1 for 2021–2023 (post-shift), 0 for 2017–2019 (baseline); 2020 is excluded as a transitional year.
- **β₃**: the DiD estimator — the differential post-shift change in outcomes for mothers vs. childless women. For the primary (hours) specification, a significant positive β₃ indicates a narrowing of the penalty on the intensive margin; the same estimator on the secondary (employment) specification indicates a narrowing extensive-margin penalty.
- **X'**: controls (education, age group, marital status, religiosity, district — see `DEFAULT_CONTROLS` below); errors are clustered by individual (`IDPUF`).

The secondary (employment) regression is estimated on the full pooled sample and separately for Jewish and Arab women (`Leom == 1` / `Leom == 2`), to check whether the effect differs by population group.

The project implements a fuller empirical strategy, tracked checkpoint-by-checkpoint in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md):
- the **primary intensive-margin** regression on usual weekly work hours (conditional on employment), plus
  a Lee (2009) trimming-bounds correction (`intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R`) for the selection risk
  that conditioning on employment introduces (see `docs/decisions/intensive-margin-lee-bounds.md`),
- a **primary triple-differences (DDD) mechanism regression on hours** (`WorkHoursCont ~ Mother×Post×WFH_Exposure`, pure occupation-level exposure), plus a generalized Lee-bounds correction and Imbens-Manski CI, testing whether the narrowing penalty is actually driven by an occupation's remote-work exposure — see [`docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md`](docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md). Unconditional (default pipeline run, no feature flag) as of the pivot,
- the same **DDD mechanism regression on employment** (`Employed ~ Mother×Post×WFH_Exposure`, cell-based exposure) as the secondary specification, cross-referenced against literature anchors (Bloom; Cohen & Manor 2024). The three occupation-level robustness variants of this secondary DDD (calibrated/external/realized exposure, `ddd_regression.R`) were deprecated and removed — see `docs/decisions/employment-ddd-robustness-removal.md`,
- a **gender placebo** test (fathers vs. childless men) to check the effect is motherhood-specific rather than a general parenthood/macro shift — an insignificant β₃ here supports the motherhood-specific reading (currently only implemented for the secondary/employment specification),
- a robustness check comparing the full sample against `Muasak`-observed-only rows,
- and a set of descriptive/child-age breakdowns (employment trajectories by youngest child's age, on the premise that younger children demand more intensive care).

Two methodological gaps between the original research plan and the actual CBS extract were resolved as recorded decisions rather than left ambiguous — see [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/):
- the WFH-exposure index anchors to **2021**, not the originally-planned 2020 (no 2020 raw extract exists for this project),
- the age control is the categorical **`GilNK`** age-group code, not continuous age/age² (no continuous age or birth-year variable exists in the raw extract).

A further pivot changed which margin is primary: see [`docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md`](docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md) for the decision to make weekly work hours (not binary employment) the project's primary dependent variable, and `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s Checkpoint 11.

## Data

- **Source**: Israeli CBS Labor Force Survey microdata. Raw files are yearly CSVs with Hebrew-transliterated variable names (e.g. `Muasak` = employed, `AvodaMeHaBayit` = works from home, `Leom` = population group).
- **Not included in this repo**: raw CSVs are gitignored and must be supplied locally. Edit `folder_path` at the top of `main.R` to point at your local data folder.
- **Sample**: women aged 25–59 by default, survey years 2017–2019 and 2021–2023 (2020 excluded — no raw extract exists for that year). `load_and_clean_data(folder_path, sex_filter = "men")` builds the analogous male subsample used by the gender placebo test.
- **Caching**: the first run cleans the raw CSVs and saves the result as `cleaned_df.rds` in the data folder, alongside a small `cleaned_df.rds.meta.rds` sidecar recording a hash of `data_processing.R`. Subsequent runs reuse the cache automatically, but only while that hash still matches — if `data_processing.R` has changed since the cache was built, `main.R` detects the mismatch and rebuilds automatically, so no manual delete step is needed.
- **Schema-drift guard**: before a fresh (non-cached) load, `check_schema_drift()` verifies that a handful of name-bounded column ranges — used by positional `select(-(a:b))` drops in `data_processing.R` — occupy the same columns across every year's CSV, so a future CBS format change fails loudly instead of silently dropping the wrong data.
- **Validation guard**: every load (cached or fresh) is checked by `validate_cleaned_df()`, which hard-fails (`stop()`) on impossible states (wrong sex code, out-of-range age group, a stray 2020 row, NAs in `Employed`/`Mother`/`Post`, zero rows) and warns on soft thresholds (a regression control with >5% NA, etc.).

## Setup & running

Dependencies: R with the `tidyverse` and `fixest` packages (no lockfile/renv — just install both). Do not add a new dependency without flagging it first (project convention).

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "fixest"))
```

Then edit `folder_path` in `main.R` to your local data folder and run:

```r
source("main.R")
```

or from a shell: `Rscript main.R`.

This runs the full default pipeline — load/validate data, comparative stats, the primary intensive-margin regression plus its Lee (2009) selection-bounds correction, the primary hours DDD (occupation-level exposure, calibrated/external/realized variants) plus its Lee bounds, the three secondary employment regressions (pooled, Jewish, Arab), child-age descriptives, diagnostics, and the full WFH-exposure/secondary-DDD analysis (four exposure measures, an ISCO-masking sensitivity check, the secondary cell-based DDD with a runtime collinearity diagnostic) — then writes every result to `outputs/` (see below). Two pieces of the empirical strategy are deliberately **not** wired into this default run and must be invoked manually:

```r
# Robustness check: full sample vs. Muasak-observed-only
source("main.R"); basic_reg_comp(cleaned_df)

# Gender placebo test (loads and validates a separate male subsample)
source(file.path("scripts", "gender_placebo.R")); run_gender_placebo(folder_path)
source(file.path("scripts", "hours_gender_placebo.R")); run_hours_gender_placebo(folder_path)
```

A third, fully separate script, `run_mismatch.R` (`Rscript run_mismatch.R`), runs a descriptive-only mismatch exhibit against a cached `cleaned_df.rds` — it requires `data/israeli_cbs_wfh_2digit.csv`, which (unlike the raw CBS CSVs) *is* included in this repo.

### Tests

```r
Rscript run_tests.R
```

Runs the `testthat` suite in `tests/testthat/` (data processing, validation, schema-drift, every regression function, export, and a full-pipeline smoke test) against fixture CSVs checked into the repo, exiting non-zero on any failure. Any change touching a function used elsewhere (`data_processing.R`, the controls list) should be green on this suite before being considered done.

## Project structure

`main.R`, `run_tests.R`, and `run_mismatch.R` are top-level entry-point scripts and stay at the repo root; every single-function file lives under `scripts/`. `robustness/` holds the Phase 1b/1c robustness-chain scripts for the secondary (employment) DDD (`balance_test.R`, `age_balance_robustness.R`, `pretrend_wald_test.R`) — each defines several related functions, so they don't fit `scripts/`'s one-function-per-file convention; none are called by `main.R` by default (`RUN_AGE_BALANCE_ROBUSTNESS`), run them manually as needed. A fourth robustness script, `phase2_robustness.R`, was deprecated and removed — see `docs/decisions/employment-ddd-robustness-removal.md`. `data/` holds small, versioned external inputs the pipeline needs (currently just the Dingel & Neiman teleworkability crosswalk).

| File | Function | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `main.R` | — | Entry point. Sources all modules from `scripts/`, loads/validates/cleans data (with caching and schema-drift checking), runs comparative stats, the baseline regressions, the intensive-margin regression, child-age descriptives, and diagnostics, then exports every result to `outputs/`. |
| `scripts/data_processing.R` | `load_and_clean_data()` | Loads raw CSVs, filters to the analysis sample, and builds every derived variable (see below). Also defines `DEFAULT_CONTROLS`, the single source of truth for regression controls. |
| `scripts/validation.R` | `validate_cleaned_df()`, `check_schema_drift()`, `check_idpuf_panel_structure()`, `check_wfh_refweek_avadbeshavua()` | Hard/soft-fail data-quality guards on the cleaned data; a header-only guard against CBS column-order drift breaking the positional column drops; a reporting-only check on how much `IDPUF` repeats across years/the Post divide; and a verification of the `WFH_RefWeek`/`AvadBeshavua` raw-data assumption stated in `data_processing.R`'s comments. |
| `scripts/comparative_statistics.R` | `run_comparative_stats()` | Missingness audit, employment-variable audit (`Muasak` vs. `Employed` vs. work hours), `WorkHoursCont` summary stats among the employed, employment rates by mother status, and a work-mobility-over-time trend plot. |
| `scripts/basic_regression.R` | `basic_reg()` | Secondary DiD regression: `Employed ~ Mother + Post + Mother:Post + controls`, clustered by `IDPUF`. |
| `scripts/basic_reg_compared_data.R` | `basic_reg_comp()` | Robustness check comparing the full sample against `Muasak`-observed-only rows. Defined but **not called by default** from `main.R` — run manually if needed. |
| `scripts/intensive_margin_regression.R` | `run_intensive_margin_reg()` | **Primary** DiD regression: `WorkHoursCont ~ Mother + Post + Mother:Post + controls`, estimated on `Employed == 1` only. |
| `scripts/intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R` | `run_intensive_margin_lee_bounds()` | Lee (2009) trimming-bounds correction for the above: since `Employed` is itself a DiD outcome, conditioning the hours regression on `Employed == 1` risks selection bias if WFH differentially pulls marginal mothers into work post-2021. Reports a `[lower, upper]` bound on `Mother:Post` alongside the untrimmed point estimate — see `docs/decisions/intensive-margin-lee-bounds.md`. |
| `scripts/gender_placebo.R` | `run_gender_placebo()` | Loads/validates the male subsample and reruns `basic_reg()` on it (fathers vs. childless men), as a placebo for the motherhood-specific interpretation (secondary/employment outcome). Sourced by `main.R` but **not called by default**. |
| `scripts/hours_gender_placebo.R` | `run_hours_gender_placebo()` | Same placebo idea, primary (hours) outcome: reruns `run_intensive_margin_reg()` plus an hours-outcome DDD placebo on the male subsample. Sourced by `main.R` but **not called by default**. |
| `scripts/wfh_exposure_index.R` | `build_wfh_exposure_index()` | Occupation-level (ISCO-08) WFH-exposure index, anchored to 2021 (see `docs/decisions/checkpoint6-wfh-anchor-year.md`). Sourced and called by default from `main.R` (one of four exposure measures — see `docs/decisions/calibrated-exposure-and-cell-ddd.md`). |
| `scripts/isco_masking_diagnostics.R` | `check_isco_masking_sensitivity()` | Sensitivity check for CBS's ISCO-08 disclosure masking: since `wfh_exposure_index.R`/`wfh_exposure_cells.R` both drop masked-occupation rows, this compares realized WFH between masked and unmasked rows within the same coarse (`ISCO1`) occupation family, as a proxy for whether that dropped subsample is likely biasing the exposure index. |
| `scripts/ddd_collinearity_diagnostics.R` | `check_spec1_collinearity()`, `check_for_dropped_coefficients()` | Runtime collinearity diagnostic for the secondary (employment) DDD's Spec 1 (additive controls): recomputes `WFH_Exposure`'s own R²/VIF against the cell-defining controls and the Spec 1 design matrix's condition number from the live data, so these figures can't silently go stale as a hardcoded comment would. Base R only (`lm()`, `kappa()`) — deliberately avoids adding `car` as a dependency. `check_for_dropped_coefficients()` is reused by both the employment and hours DDDs. |
| `scripts/hours_ddd_regression.R` | `run_hours_ddd_regression()` | **Primary** triple-differences DDD on hours: `WorkHoursCont ~ Mother*Post*WFH_Exposure + controls`, pure occupation-level exposure, `Employed == 1` only, plus a precision-weighted second-stage mechanism regression. Called by default from `main.R` §8a, three times — once each for the calibrated, external, and realized exposure measures — see `docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md`. |
| `scripts/hours_ddd_lee_bounds.R` | `run_hours_ddd_lee_bounds()` | Generalized Lee (2009) bounds for the above: selection counterfactual stratified by cell-based `WFH_Exposure` quartile, outcome regression on occupation-level `WFH_Exposure`. Called by default from `main.R` §8a. |
| `scripts/imbens_manski_ci.R` | `imbens_manski_ci()` | Shared Imbens-Manski (2004) partial-identification CI solver, reused by both `intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R` and `hours_ddd_lee_bounds.R`. |
| `scripts/israeli_market_mismatch.R` | `check_market_mismatch()` | Descriptive-only exhibit comparing theoretical (Dingel & Neiman) vs. realized (2022-23) WFH by occupation — a thin wrapper around `calibrate_isco_exposure()`. Takes an `exposure_path` parameter (default: the real, locally-supplied `israeli_cbs_wfh_2digit.csv`) so it's testable without that file. Invoked via `run_mismatch.R`, not sourced by `main.R`. |
| `scripts/employment_by_child_age.R` | `employment_by_child_age()` | Employment rates and a controlled regression by youngest-child age bin, with raw/adjusted-rate plots. |
| `scripts/Diagnostics.R` | `run_diagnostics()` | 2×2 DiD table, event-study pre-trend plot, and missing-value audits for the regression variables. |
| `scripts/export_results.R` | `export_all_results()` | Walks the heterogeneous result lists returned by every analysis function and writes each data frame to CSV and each `ggplot` to PNG under `outputs/`. |
| `run_tests.R` | — | `testthat` runner (`Rscript run_tests.R`); exits non-zero on failure. |

## Key variables

| Variable | Definition |
|---|---|
| `WorkHoursCont` | **Primary dependent variable.** Continuous usual weekly work hours, derived from the binned `ShaotAvodaBederechKlalNK` (bin medians; irregular-hours codes imputed from observed medians in the matching range). Defined only for `Employed == 1`. |
| `Employed` | Secondary dependent variable, and the selection variable for `WorkHoursCont`'s Lee-bounds correction. `1` if `Muasak == 1` ("employed"), else `0` — unemployed and not-in-labor-force are both treated as not working. |
| `Mother` | `1` if the respondent has any children under 17 (sex-agnostic in derivation — read as "Father" for the male subsample used in the gender placebo test). |
| `Post` | `1` for survey years ≥ 2021 (the post-WFH-shift period). |
| `WFH` | Works-from-home indicator; only defined for 2021+ (not asked pre-COVID). Feeds the WFH-exposure index. |
| `TeudaGvoha` | Highest education, collapsed into 6 groups: Below High School, High School (no matriculation), Matriculation (Bagrut), Post-secondary non-academic, Academic Degree (BA/MA/PhD), Other/No Certificate. |
| `BirthContinent` | Country of birth grouped by continent (Israel kept as its own category rather than folded into Asia); a small multi-continent CBS code is bucketed as "Other". |
| `WorksOutsideLocality` | `1` if she commutes outside her locality of residence for work, derived from `DargatNayadut`; used in comparative statistics only, not as a regression control. |
| `MishlachYad_ISCO_08_2` | 2-digit ISCO-08 occupation code; the join key for the WFH-exposure index and DDD regression. |

`DEFAULT_CONTROLS` (defined once in `scripts/data_processing.R`, reused by `basic_regression.R`, `basic_reg_compared_data.R`, `intensive_margin_regression.R`, `employment_by_child_age.R`, `Diagnostics.R`, `hours_diagnostics.R`, and `hours_ddd_regression.R`): `MatzavMishpachti` (marital status), `Dat` (religiosity), `GilNK` (age group), `MachozMegurim` (district of residence), `TeudaGvoha` (education) — all treated as categorical factors.

## Outputs

`Rscript main.R` writes one file per result table/plot to `outputs/` (CSV for tables, PNG for plots) via `export_all_results()`. `outputs/` is **tracked in git**, not gitignored — but several breakdowns (e.g. the Arab-women-only stratified regression) can produce small cells from real CBS microdata, so nothing generated under it should be `git add`ed/committed without a human explicitly reviewing it first for disclosure risk (see `CLAUDE.md`). Tracking the directory removes the structural gitignore block, not that review requirement.

## Known limitations

- **Survey weights are intentionally not applied in any regression.** CBS weight columns (`MishkalSofi`, `MishkalShnati`, etc.) exist in the raw data and are deliberately excluded from every regression in this repo (`basic_reg()`, the intensive-margin/DDD models, the pretrend model, etc.) — this is a scope decision, not an oversight, and should not be "fixed" without a separate discussion. Reported rates and regression coefficients are unweighted estimates on the analysis sample, not population-representative statistics. (The one exception is `build_exposure_cells()` in `wfh_exposure_cells.R`, which does weight by `MishkalSofi` when aggregating occupation exposure up to demographic cells — that weighting is internal to building the exposure regressor, not a survey-representativeness correction for the outcome regressions themselves.)
- The WFH-exposure index and age controls both deviate from the research doc's literal specification, as documented decisions (see `docs/decisions/`), because the raw CBS extract lacks a 2020 file and any continuous age/birth-year variable.

## Documentation map

Before implementing anything, read (in this order): [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) (the checkpoint in question), [`docs/LLD.md`](docs/LLD.md) (schema/contracts), [`docs/HLD.md`](docs/HLD.md) (why the gap exists). For how to test something, `tests/testthat/` (run via `Rscript run_tests.R`) is the source of truth — [`docs/archive/TESTING_BLUEPRINT.md`](docs/archive/TESTING_BLUEPRINT.md) is an archived pre-restructure planning doc, kept for history only. The original research plan (research question, literature review, and initial empirical design) has been folded into the "Background" and "Research design" sections above; `docs/LLD.md`/`docs/HLD.md` reconcile it against the real codebase and are the authoritative reference for any gap between plan and implementation.
