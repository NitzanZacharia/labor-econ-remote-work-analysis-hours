# Generates the two synthetic fixture CSVs (sample_2019_Data.csv, sample_2021_Data.csv) used by
# the test suite. 100% synthetic, invented values — no real CBS microdata. Only the columns
# load_and_clean_data() actually references (by name, in filters/mutates/factor-conversion) or
# needs as boundary markers for its 7 positional range-drops are included; everything else in the
# real raw CSVs is irrelevant to what these tests check. Re-run this script (`Rscript
# tests/testthat/fixtures/generate_fixtures.R` from the repo root) to regenerate the CSVs if this
# spec ever changes — the row-by-row plan here is also mirrored (by IDPUF) in
# test-data_processing.R's expectations, so keep the two in sync if you edit this file.
