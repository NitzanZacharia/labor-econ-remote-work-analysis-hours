# test-intensive_margin_lee_bounds.R
# Unit tests for run_intensive_margin_lee_bounds() (the DiD-adapted Lee (2009) trimming-bounds
# correction for intensive_margin_regression.R's Employed==1 conditioning). Two synthetic designs:
# one with no differential selection (bounds must collapse exactly to the point estimate), and one
# with a hand-constructed excess-selection cell where the trimmed lower/upper bounds are exactly
# hand-computable from the two subgroups making up that cell.

# just some control levels. A dedicated, adequately-sized synthetic panel with real random
# variation in every control (matching test-balance_test.R's make_balance_panel() convention)
