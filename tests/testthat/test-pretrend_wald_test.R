# ── Integration: couple this to the REAL run_diagnostics()-produced model ────────────────────
# The two tests above are valuable for their exact, hand-verifiable df/regex checks, but they run
# entirely against make_pretrend_model()'s own independently hand-built formula -- if
# Diagnostics.R's actual pretrend_model formula ever changes (different controls, a different ref
# year, an added Mother-interacted term), these tests would keep passing against their own frozen
# copy while run_pretrend_joint_test() could silently mis-specify the Wald restriction set in
# production. This test closes that gap by feeding the REAL run_diagnostics() output in.
#
# Deliberately NOT built from the shared fixtures_dir CSVs: those only cover survey years
# 2019/2021-2023 (no 2017/2018 at all -- confirmed empirically), so wald()'s pre-2020 regex
# matches zero terms against them and degenerates to a bare NA rather than a proper Wald object.
# This builds its own minimal temp-CSV fixture spanning 2017/2018/2019/2021, following the same
# self-contained-temp-fixture convention test-data_processing.R's "differs by Post period" test
# already uses for the same class of reason (the shared fixtures don't cover what's needed here).
