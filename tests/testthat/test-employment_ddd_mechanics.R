# test-employment_ddd_mechanics.R
# Correctness/bounds companion to test-pipeline_smoke.R's existing smoke test of main.R's section
# 8b (the SECONDARY, extensive-margin DDD: cell-based WFH_Exposure, two feols specs -- demoted from
# "primary" by the hours pivot, docs/decisions/hours-ddd-pivot.md; hours_ddd_regression.R's
# run_hours_ddd_regression() is now the primary DDD, section 8a). That smoke test only asserts
# expect_s3_class(..., "fixest") -- it never checks that the mechanism the decision memo argues
# for (docs/decisions/calibrated-exposure-and-cell-ddd.md) actually holds: that Spec 2's fully
# interacted cell FE absorbs WFH_Exposure's bare main effect as collinear, leaving identification
# to come from within-cell Mother/Post variation. This file builds a dedicated synthetic panel
# (following test-gender_placebo.R's run_gender_ddd_placebo pattern -- the fixtures are sized for
# schema tests, not for a saturated triple-interaction to be identified) with the exposure
# regressor built through the real pipeline (build_exposure_cells(), then left_join()ed back by
# cell), and reproduces main.R's two feols calls verbatim (its ddd_employment_additive /
# ddd_employment_fe block) so a future edit to the real formulas that isn't mirrored here will
# visibly diverge.

# main.R's real employment DDD (§8b) now builds WFH_Exposure on a partition (exposure_cell_vars) FINER than
# cell_fe_vars -- as of this update it additionally varies by MatzavMishpachti, Dat, and
# BirthContinent (this panel only exercises MatzavMishpachti -- the mechanism being tested here is
# general to "any extra dimension not in cell_fe_vars", not tied to the real list's exact current
# length) -- specifically so it is no longer exactly collinear with Spec 2's fully interacted cell
# FE (verified against real data: MatzavMishpachti+Dat cut the design's minimum detectable effect
# by ~37%; adding BirthContinent cut it a further ~18%). This panel mirrors that real design
# (unlike make_ddd_panel() above, which deliberately keeps exposure_cell_vars == cell_fe_vars to
# document the OLD aliasing mechanism) and asserts the opposite drop behavior.
