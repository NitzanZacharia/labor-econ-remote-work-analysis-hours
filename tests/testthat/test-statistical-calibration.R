# test-statistical-calibration.R
# Closes a gap the audit named: every existing "invariant" test in the robustness/diagnostics
# suite checks a single seeded draw's sign or exact-formula recovery, never whether a hypothesis
# test's own empirical rejection rate matches its nominal size under a genuinely null DGP. A bug
# that broke clustering, used the wrong degrees of freedom, or swapped in the wrong grouping
# variable would still pass every existing single-draw check while silently inflating Type-I
# error -- this is the first test in the suite that would actually catch that class of bug.
#
# Targets robustness/balance_test.R's Welch t-test on GilNK -- run_balance_test()'s
# gilnk_ttests uses exactly `t.test(gilnk_num(GilNK) ~ Mother, data = .x)` per WFH_Exposure
# quartile (see that file). Calling the full run_balance_test() wrapper thousands of times to get
# enough replications for a precise rejection-rate estimate is far too slow for a unit-test suite
# (~0.55s/call, measured: 500 reps would add ~4.5 minutes) -- this reproduces that exact t.test()
# call directly instead, at a rep count high enough for a tight rejection-rate estimate, which
# runs in well under a second. The quartile-grouping/join machinery run_balance_test() wraps
# around it is already covered by test-balance_test.R's structural tests; what's untested
# anywhere else is whether the t-test ITSELF is calibrated.

# The calibration test below reproduces run_balance_test()'s t-test rather than calling it, for the
# speed reason above. That reproduction is only meaningful while the two stay the same call, and
# nothing else in the suite would notice if balance_test.R switched to a different test or dropped
# the Welch default. This pins them together at zero runtime cost -- if it fails, fix the
# reproduction below to match the source before trusting the rejection rate.
