# Project conventions for Claude Code

- This is a set of R scripts (no package layout — no DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE, no roxygen, no
  installed-package semantics). Dependencies: tidyverse + fixest only. Do not add a new dependency
  without flagging it in your response first.
- `main.R` is the orchestrator and stays at the repo root, alongside `run_tests.R` and
  `run_mismatch.R`. Every other .R file defines one function, lives in `scripts/`, and is
  `source()`d via a root-relative, path-qualified call (`source(file.path("scripts", "foo.R"))`) —
  never a bare filename, since cwd is assumed to be the repo root wherever sourcing happens.
  `robustness/` is the one exception to "one function per file": it holds the multi-function
  robustness-chain scripts (`balance_test.R`, `age_balance_robustness.R`, `pretrend_wald_test.R`),
  sourced the same cwd-relative, path-qualified way
  (`source(file.path("robustness", "foo.R"))`) — never moved into `scripts/`.
- `data/` holds small, versioned external inputs the pipeline needs (currently just the Dingel &
  Neiman teleworkability crosswalk, `data/israeli_cbs_wfh_2digit.csv`) — distinct from the raw CBS
  microdata below, which is never checked into the repo.
- Raw CBS CSVs are gitignored and live outside the repo (real path is set locally in main.R's
  `folder_path`). Never assume they're present in a sandbox; check before running Rscript against them.
- `DEFAULT_CONTROLS <- c("MatzavMishpachti","Dat","GilNK","MachozMegurim","TeudaGvoha")`, defined
  once in `scripts/data_processing.R`, is the single source of truth once Checkpoint 3 lands —
  don't reintroduce a local copy in any new file.
- CBS survey weights (`MishkalSofi`, `MishkalShnati`, etc.) are intentionally NOT applied in any
  outcome regression — see README.md's "Known limitations". This is a deliberate scope decision,
  not a gap. Do not add `weights =` to a `feols()`/`lm()` call in this repo without raising it with
  the user first. `build_exposure_cells()` (`wfh_exposure_cells.R`) is the one existing exception —
  it weights by `MishkalSofi` when aggregating occupation exposure up to demographic cells, which is
  internal to constructing the exposure regressor and not a survey-representativeness correction.
- Before implementing anything, read: docs/ROADMAP.md (the checkpoint in question),
  docs/LLD.md (schema/contracts), docs/HLD.md (why the gap exists). Don't implement from the
  research doc directly — LLD/HLD already reconcile it against the real codebase. For how to test
  something, the live `tests/testthat/` suite is the source of truth — `docs/archive/TESTING_BLUEPRINT.md`
  is a pre-`scripts/`-restructure planning doc, kept only for history.
- Every change that touches a function used elsewhere (data_processing.R, the controls list)
  needs the full `Rscript run_tests.R` suite green before you consider the task done.
